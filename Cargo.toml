description = "Question Bank Creator.  This program is targeted at teachers & homeschool parents and is especially useful for teaching math.  It allows the construction of test/worksheet/quiz questions that contain dynamic content.  The teacher can create variables that generate values/strings using random or pseudo-random criteria set by the user.  Once constructed, the question is stored in a file (or 'question bank') for later access as needed.  Teachers can also make the program/questions available to students for student directed practice."
