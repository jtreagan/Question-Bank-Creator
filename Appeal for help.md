# Why Question Bank Creator?

   * Think back to your days in high school when you sat in math class day after day totally mystified as to what your teacher was trying to teach you.  You had tried the problems in the homework, but kept getting stuck.  There was one problem type in particular that especially stymied you.  A test was coming up and you knew that kind of problem was going to be on it.  Your teacher, Mr. R., did take the time to explain it to you, taking you step by step (he was a good guy and really did try his best to help you understand), but you really needed more practice with that problem and others like it.  Wouldn’t it have been nice if you could have had two or three more problems to practice on, problems that were basically the same, but had different numbers and other parameters making them only sort of different?  With Mr. R. working you through the first couple of those nearly identical problems, the other types of problem would likely have come easier and you’d have been ready for the upcoming test.  Too bad there wasn’t an app that would have set those problems up for you to practice until you got it right.  Hmmmmm……

   * Now, suppose you are a homeschooling mother and your son and daughter are both working through their math.  Your son, Robert is a couple of years older than his sister, Susan.  Robert, is learning Algebra 2 and mostly doing okay, while Susan is struggling with Algebra 1.  Math has never been easy for Susan, but you know that knowing her math will make or break whether or not she is successful in life, so you keep working with her.  (Robert is helpful, too, although he tends to get impatient when she doesn’t quickly get his explanations and then Susan starts crying....)  Today, Susan is stuck on distance, rate, and time problems and you are finding yourself wishing that you had some kind of app that would generate the same kind of problem over and over.  Then Susan could practice that style of problem until she started feeling confident in her abilities.  Two or three problems of the same type (with different values and other parameters) and the light would probably turn on for her and the problems would likely become easier.  Hmmmmm……

   * Now, go back to your calculus classes.  I didn’t do calculus until I started junior college.  We called my college calculus teacher “Big Mac” because he was...well, big?  (We weren’t being mean.  I think he’s the one who gave us that nickname to use.)  Anyway, Big Mac was good about showing us how to work all the different types of integrals and differentiations and such, but there were so many of them!  I’ve always been good at my math, but this overwhelmed me.  It sure would have been nice if I could have just pulled up an app and practiced the more difficult problems – same problems with different values and other parameters – until I really, truly understood them.  Hmmmmm……

   * There are applications available that make this possible, but most of them are proprietary and tied to specific publications or other commercial uses.  As near as I can tell, there isn’t a single open-source app out there that will do what Question Bank Creator is designed to do.  The problem is that QBC is getting too big for me to manage or finish on my own and I need help.  

   * Rust programmers – would you consider joining me in developing this tool?
